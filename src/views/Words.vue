              A poem to our dearest friend,
              <br />who is a Queen like Rachel, Weirdo like Phoebe, and
              Organized like Monica.
              <br />
              <br />Twas monsoon, the year was 2017,
              <br />Enter 4 friends, the season evergreen
              <br />
              <br />Enters you, with a missing smile,
              <br />Yellow shirt and green bag was your style
              <br />
              <br />Standing in the corner, staying always quiet
              <br />But you blew our minds by studying all night,
              <br />
              <br />Surprised was the gang, the day you did bangs
              <br />You were looking cute, just like a fruit
              <br />
              <br />Because of you, we explored various dishes
              <br />But you were drinking karela juice just like riches
              <br />
              <br />From doubt clearing to food selection
              <br />You always showed us the right direction,
              <br />
              <br />During Felicity, you danced on the beats
              <br />A gujju doing Garba never looked more sweet
              <br />
              <br />Keep sharing food as you always do
              <br />Bcoz that‚Äôs how we enjoyed a lot of free food.
              <br />
              <br />We went to Khajaguda Hills, to enjoy the real thrills
              <br />Thanks for the Pondi trip, without you it would have been skipped.
              <br />

              <br/>
              <br/>Fortunately, I got a friend like you.
              <br/>You are the one who keeps our group alive and together.
              <br/>We are so happy to have you in our lives.
              <br/>
              <br/>We have had so many great memories together.
              <br/>Our trip to Pachmari, your maternity clothes (Lol),
              <br/>your nakhre when we try to click your pics, and so on.
              <br/>Remember, while we were trekking in the forest
              <br/>and I accidentally invited hundreds of ants over me,
              <br/>you were having so much fun.
              <br/>Instead  of helping me get rid of them,
              <br/>you were filming me(sweet bitch).
              <br/>
              <br/>Keeping the jokes aside,you have a pure heart
              <br/>and that makes you a treasure in our lives.
              <br/>I know the hardships that you have crossed
              <br/>to reach where you are right now.
              <br/>I have seen you working hard everyday
              <br/>for everything you aspire.
              <br/>And the best part about you is that you never give up.
              <br/>
              <br/>You are a true inspiration and a great friend.

              <br/>Hey bub,
              <br/>I won't be reiterating on memories,
              <br/>Nor am I great with words.
              <br/>So here it goes.
              <br/><br/>
              <br/>One of the reasons I remained steady in college was you.
              <br/>Thanks for helping me bounce back.
              <br/><br/>
              <br/>But, I do have a few things I want to ask from you.
              <br/>
              <br/>That you will believe in yourself and keep pushing,
              <br/>no matter how hard the situation gets.
              <br/>You are doing really well !
              <br/>
              <br/>And, that you will trust people who are close to you.
              <br/>You are not alone, you have so many friends who love you!
              <br/>Differences in time and space don't and shouldn't affect bonds between people.
              <br/>All you gotta do is pickup the phone and call :)
              <br/>
              <br/>And yeah, bear with me if possible XD
              <br/>
              <br/>Lots of lou to foony gal.
